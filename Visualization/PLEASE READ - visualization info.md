Here I will explain what the given visualizations and data table are:

## Techpoint Visualization.png
Here we see 2 maps of Indiana, one just being a zoomed in version of the other.

The dots we see on the map are all of the events and restaurants, along with the housing location and the selected Industrious Mass Ave coworking space.

This visualization is helpful as it gives us an idea of how close all of the locations are with respect to the coworking space - 
there is only one event that is far away, and that is the emotional intelligence conference.

Thus, this visualization gives us confidence that the coworking space we have chosen is indeed a convenient location, as we see that it is quite well 
centralized among the other events, restaurants, and housing locations.
