Here I will give more information on how the Table of Workspace and Travel Distances.csv is useful:

As a company, we are looking to choose a coworking space that is most convenient for it's interns.
One way to measure convenience is in travel distance: the most convenient location will minimize total travel distance, 
not just between the housing location and coworking space, but between the coworking space and all other events / restaurants that one will be travelling to.

Thus, by looking at the total travel distance required from each coworking space... 

## we see that the Industrious Mass Ave location is the most convenient coworking space.
